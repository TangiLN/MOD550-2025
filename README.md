Repository for the subject MOD550 Machine Learning 

## Introduction 
Machine learning has recently emerged as one of the most promising resources for engineers, offering a set of powerful approaches to tackle complex engineering challenges. By employing various statistical techniques in learning algorithms, machine learning enables the development of predictive models, optimization strategies, and decision support systems that can enhance the design, analysis, and control of engineered systems. This technology empowers engineers to extract meaningful insights from vast datasets, automate repetitive tasks, and improve the efficiency, reliability, and performance of engineering processes. Its applications span diverse domains, from mechanical and chemical engineering to geo, material science, etc. making machine learning an indispensable resource for modern computational engineers for physics based and data-driven solutions to real-world problems.

## Firsts tasks of the project 

- Task 1: make a histogram from a 2d random distribution
- Task 2: make a 2d heat map from a 2d random distribution
- Task 3: make a histogram for the source data you selected
- Task 4: convert the histogram into a discrete PMF
- Task 5: calculate the cumulative for each feature
